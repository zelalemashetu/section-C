# the casefold() method returns a string where all the characters are lower case.

# This method is similar to the lower() method,
#  but the casefold() method is stronger, more aggressive, meaning that it will convert more characters into lower case,
#  and will find more matches when comparing two strings and both are converted using the casefold() method

# Syntax
# string.casefold()
